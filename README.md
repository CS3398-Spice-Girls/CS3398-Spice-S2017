Our app right now has a main page and allows you to upload or drag and drop an image. Once an image is uploaded, a color pallet will be generated. Users can select the number of colors to be generated by using the "Auto" button in the top left corner. Users can also share the color pallet by using the "Share" button in the top right corner.
